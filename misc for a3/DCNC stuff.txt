	MAC Address is fixed and never changes
IP is Network Layer

Q2
CSMA
	Collision Detection
	Collision Avoidance
Perisistent
	keep checking channel if idle send
	collisions increase as propagation delay increases
Non-Persistent
	if channel is busy wait random time before trying again
Probability
	if idle attempt to send
	if busy and check if p is less than predefined amount
	recalc p and check if p is less than predefined p

Q3
X->a-b-c->Y:transmitting 56 octets
each packet has 4 octets header

4 * 60 octets: time in octet times = 240ot
5 * 32 octets: 160ot
10 * 12 octets: 120ot
17 * 8 octets: 136ot
